unreleased

UI additions

  Buffer#find
* bracketed paste - pasting a URL now opens the URL bar automatically
* "copy URL", "copy selection" now works over SSH when OSC 52 is supported
* "hints mode" for jumping to specific links on the page (default
  keybinding is `f`, configurable using `input.link-hint-chars`)

---
CSS additions

---
UI changes
* improved highlighting in monochrome mode
* more sensible semantics for pager.load() - empty string now works, newline at
  end deprecated in favor of pager.loadSubmit()
* mouse improvements:
	- click on status bar opens URL bar: left click -> current URL, right
	  click -> URL under cursor, middle click -> empty URL bar
	- double click + drag selects text
* fixed flash of unstyled content and removed blank screen on page load
---
Misc changes
* history, cookies, etc. are now saved in XDG_DATA_HOME for XDG basedir users
  (instead of XDG_CONFIG_HOME)
	- users that store their config in ~/.chawan are not affected
* unify binaries that link to OpenSSL in dynamically linked builds, and
  unify markdown, gemini, etc. -> HTML converters
* allow overriding pkg-config path in Makefile (using PKG_CONFIG)
* better color approximation in "eight-bit" color mode (256 colors)
* #L{n} (e.g. #L1) jumps to nth line in plain text files (idea from Dillo)
* console buffer is now spawned on demand
---
Removals
* remove deprecated prepend-https, css and stylesheet config options (use
  prepend-scheme, user-style instead)
* remove protocol.form-request config option (read the body in CGI instead)
---
Optimizations
* layout caching (makes a huge difference in memory usage and performance)
* CSS parser is now single-pass (kind of)
* cascade: eliminate several allocations, merge hash maps for separate origins
* more compact DOM representation (uses doubly linked list instead of a vector)
* insert style sheets incrementally instead of traversing DOM several times
* async terminal handling (printing large Sixels no longer blocks the rest of
  the pager)
---
