reduce binary size:
- fbf for unifont
charsets:
- set up some fuzzer
- use appropriate charsets in forms, urls, etc.
display:
- important: buffer list menu
- dark mode (basically max Y)
config:
- important: config editor
- better siteconf URL matching
- $TERM-based display config
- add RPC for CGI scripts e.g. toggle settings/issue downloads/etc
	* also some way to set permissions for RPC calls
mailcap:
- save custom command? (or a mailcap command editor like w3m)
- w3mmee extensions
	* browsecap looks cleaner than urimethodmap, and would be
	  useful for mailto
buffer:
- important: validate returned values, do not block on communication
  with buffer
	* turning buffers into a pseudo-protocol and interfacing through
	  loader may help
- color visited links
	* needs some sort of conditional formatting in pager, e.g. give
	  all Formats an id in buffer and send a list of "if URL
	  visited, change Format" commands
- xhtml
pager:
- handle long lines
- save/edit buffer output
	* just reuse dump mode code
- alert on external command failure
- pipe copiousoutput, x-htmloutput stderr to console
network:
- uBO integration? (or at least implement filter lists)
- dict
- nntp
- websockets
javascript:
- support defining one function with multiple names (maybe with magic?)
- "this" value as JSValue
- distinguish double from unrestricted double
- more events
- ReadableStream
- separate console for each buffer
layout:
- flexbox: align-self, align-items, justify-content, proper margin handling
- details element
- layout caching
	* the current approach is unmaintainable, we must factor out
	  tree traversal from layout first (i.e. rewrite it in CPS)
- partial rendering
	* buffer.lines must go, so rewrite getCursorStyledNode and
	  findPrev/NextLink to use the box tree
		- also findPrevMatch/findNextMatch, but it's hard
		  without a line array... probably we'll have to change
		  it to traverse the DOM instead
	* we must calculate the overflow box, but the current approach
	  is broken, easier to just set it as a property on render
	* inline layout's output must be flattened again, so that we can
	  deal with tall inline boxes (like the <plaintext> tag in
	  text/plain buffers)
- frame, iframe
- z order for images
- grid
images:
- animation
man:
- add a DOM -> man page converter so that we do not depend on pandoc
  for man page conversion
tests:
- pager? (how?)
