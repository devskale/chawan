# ASCII Image Rendering (AIR) Mode - Implementation Status

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Created the AIR Codec** (`adapter/img/air.nim`):
   - Implemented a codec that converts RGBA pixel data to ASCII art
   - Used a character set ordered by density: ' ', '.', ':', '-', '=', '+', '*', '#', '%', '@'
   - Implemented proper grayscale conversion using the standard luminance formula
   - Added error handling for malformed input
   - Successfully tested with various RGBA inputs

2. **Integrated with Chawan's Image Pipeline**:
   - Added `imAir` to the `ImageMode` enum in `src/config/conftypes.nim`
   - Registered the AIR codec in the URIMethodMap (`res/urimethodmap`)
   - Updated terminal code (`src/local/term.nim`) to handle the new image mode
   - Updated build system (`Makefile`) to compile the AIR codec

3. **Verified Functionality**:
   - The AIR codec correctly converts RGBA data to ASCII art
   - Chawan properly recognizes and activates AIR mode when configured
   - Basic infrastructure is in place and working

## Current State

The AIR codec is fully functional and correctly converts RGBA pixel data to ASCII art. Our tests show that:

1. The codec properly handles different image dimensions
2. It correctly converts pixel data to ASCII characters based on luminance
3. It handles transparency by converting transparent pixels to spaces
4. It supports the "info-only" mode for retrieving image dimensions

## What's Working

- The AIR codec functions correctly when tested standalone
- Chawan properly activates AIR mode when configured with `image-mode = "air"`
- The basic infrastructure is in place

## What's Not Working

- Images are not being rendered as ASCII art in the terminal because:
  1. We were testing in dump mode (-d), where images are not processed
  2. The full image processing pipeline is complex and requires proper integration

## Next Steps for Complete Implementation

To complete the AIR mode implementation, we need to:

1. **Connect the AIR codec to the rendering pipeline**:
   - Modify the CSS rendering code to recognize when AIR mode is active
   - Instead of sending image data to the terminal for Sixel or Kitty protocols, 
     convert the image to ASCII art and render it directly into the text buffer
   - Ensure proper positioning and scaling of ASCII art within the terminal

2. **Implement proper image decoding**:
   - Use the existing codec system to decode images to RGBA format
   - Pass the RGBA data to our AIR codec for ASCII conversion
   - Handle various image formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.)

3. **Improve the ASCII art rendering**:
   - Implement better character mapping algorithms
   - Add support for color mapping in terminals that support it
   - Optimize the rendering for different terminal sizes

4. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Test with actual image files in various formats
   - Optimize performance for large images
   - Verify compatibility across different terminal types

## Configuration

Users will be able to enable AIR mode by setting:
```toml
[buffer]
images = true

[display]
image-mode = "air"
```

## Benefits

1. **Universal Compatibility**: Works on any terminal that can display text
2. **No Special Protocols**: Doesn't require Sixel or Kitty support
3. **Self-Contained**: Implemented entirely within Chawan without external dependencies
4. **Configurable**: Can be enabled/disabled per user preference

## Conclusion

We have successfully implemented the core infrastructure for the ASCII Image Rendering (AIR) mode in Chawan. The AIR codec is working correctly and Chawan properly recognizes the new image mode. The remaining work involves connecting this to the rendering pipeline so that images are actually displayed as ASCII art in the terminal.
