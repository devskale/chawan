# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds ASCII image rendering capability to Chawan's AIR (ASCII Image Rendering) mode, allowing images to be displayed as ASCII characters in any character terminal. This enables Chawan to function as a fully text-based browser even on terminals that don't support modern image protocols like Sixel or Kitty graphics.

The feature integrates with Chawan's existing image processing pipeline by adding a new ASCII codec that converts images to text representations, making the browser accessible on legacy terminals, SSH connections, and environments where graphical image display is not available.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with a basic terminal that doesn't support image protocols, I want to see ASCII representations of images so that I can understand visual content on web pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN display.image-mode is set to "ascii" THEN the system SHALL render all images as ASCII characters
2. WHEN an image is encountered in ASCII mode THEN the system SHALL convert it to a text-based representation using ASCII characters
3. WHEN ASCII mode is active THEN the system SHALL maintain the approximate aspect ratio of the original image
4. WHEN ASCII mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL display ASCII images inline with the text content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ASCII image rendering to integrate seamlessly with Chawan's existing image codec system so that it follows established patterns and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing ASCII rendering THEN the system SHALL use the existing img-codec+ URI scheme pattern
2. WHEN processing images in ASCII mode THEN the system SHALL follow the same decode/encode interface as other image codecs
3. WHEN ASCII codec is invoked THEN it SHALL accept standard Cha-Image-* headers for metadata
4. WHEN ASCII rendering is complete THEN it SHALL output text data that can be displayed in the terminal canvas

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want configurable ASCII rendering quality so that I can balance between detail and readability based on my terminal size and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ASCII mode is configured THEN the system SHALL support different character sets for rendering (basic ASCII, extended ASCII, Unicode block characters)
2. WHEN rendering ASCII images THEN the system SHALL support configurable width scaling to fit terminal constraints
3. WHEN ASCII quality is specified THEN the system SHALL adjust the character density and detail level accordingly
4. WHEN terminal width is limited THEN the system SHALL automatically scale ASCII images to fit within available space

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want ASCII image rendering to work with all supported image formats so that I don't lose functionality when using text-only mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any supported image format (PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, WebP, SVG) is encountered THEN the system SHALL be able to convert it to ASCII
2. WHEN image decoding fails THEN the system SHALL display a fallback ASCII representation indicating the image type and dimensions
3. WHEN transparent images are processed THEN the system SHALL handle transparency appropriately in ASCII representation
4. WHEN animated images (GIF) are encountered THEN the system SHALL display the first frame as ASCII

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the ASCII image rendering to be performant so that page loading remains responsive even with multiple images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple images are being converted to ASCII THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently without blocking the UI
2. WHEN large images are encountered THEN the system SHALL resize them appropriately before ASCII conversion to maintain performance
3. WHEN ASCII images are cached THEN the system SHALL reuse converted representations to avoid redundant processing
4. WHEN memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL manage ASCII image cache appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily enable ASCII image mode so that I can quickly switch between different image display modes based on my current terminal capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set display.image-mode to "ascii" in config THEN the system SHALL enable ASCII image rendering
2. WHEN display.image-mode is "auto" AND no graphics protocols are detected THEN the system SHALL fall back to ASCII mode
3. WHEN I toggle image modes THEN the system SHALL refresh the current page to apply the new rendering method
4. WHEN ASCII mode is active THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the status or through appropriate user feedback
